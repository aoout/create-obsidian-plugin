## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage


## üì• Installation

- [x] Using BRAT with `https://github.com/<%= github.user %>/<%= plugin.id %>`
- [x] From the release page:

    - Unzip `<%= plugin.id %>.zip` in `.obsidian/plugins/` path
    - In Obsidian settings, reload the plugin
    - Enable the plugin

## ü§ñ Developing 

To make changes to this plugin, first ensure you have the dependencies installed.

```
<%= platform.install %>
```

To start building the plugin with what mode enabled run the following command:
```
<%= platform.dev %>
```

> **Note**  
> If you haven't already installed the hot-reload-plugin you'll be prompted to. You need to enable that plugin in your obsidian vault before hot-reloading will start. You might need to refresh your plugin list for it to show up.

To start a release build run the following command:

```
<%= platform.build %>
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `.env` file with adding the key `VAULT_DEV` to specify the path to your Obsidian (development) vault. This will allow you to test your plugin without specify each times the path to the vault.


### üì§ Export

You can use the `<%= platform.export %>` command to export your plugin to your Obsidian Main Vault. To do that, you need the `.env` file with the following content:

```env
VAULT="path/to/your/obsidian/vault"
VAULT_DEV="path/to/your/dev/vault"
```

### üéº Languages

- [x] English
- [ ] French

To add a translation:
1. Fork the repository
2. Add the translation in the `src/i18n/locales` folder with the name of the language (ex: `fr.json`). 
    - You can get your locale language from Obsidian using [obsidian translation](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations) or using the commands (in templater for example) : `<% tp.obsidian.moment.locale() %>`
    - Copy the content of the [`en.json`](./src/i18n/locales/en.json) file in the new file
    - Translate the content
3. Edit `i18n/i18next.ts` :
    - Add `import * as <lang> from "./locales/<lang>.json";`
    - Edit the `ressource` part with adding : `<lang> : {translation: <lang>}`
